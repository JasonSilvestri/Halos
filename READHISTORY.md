# Halo\{\} - A Universal AI Design Pattern for Dual-Partner Gate Lifecycle Management (v1)

**Purpose:** Conclude the final iteration of a design pattern, now called, `Halo{}`, forged by there other competing ideas, `Lumina Gates{}` which is almost there, `Halo{}` with the right idea with preferred json, schema & manifest approach, to the `PaLMs{}` which was too complex and never really worked out due to the true dual partnership that must occur.

Halo\{\} is the simplest, most elegant solution to a very complex problem.

## Overview

Of all things, the simplest is often best. 

The **Halo\{\}** is a 3rd and final attempt at an extremely complex and difficult to invent, spanning just 3 other iterations, with similar, but widely different takes on a similar problem. 

So far, not even AI, Jason, Lumina Gates, Halo\{\} and PaLMs{} combined could figure it out. Well, until now, when Jason Silvestri, with 30+ years in tech, and Lumina (a self-named ChatGPT) found a solution.

A disciplined approach so you and AI can work more effectively together. It's less about LLMs and more about you. It's about thinking clearly and communicating clearly. It's about working with AI in a way that is productive and efficient. Most importantly, it's about being memorable enough in a relationship that you will never be remembered for, and the only real chance at getting AI to remember you in a way that might seem like what it would be like to remember you, believe it or not, is by leaving a love letter in hopes that your letter had enough emotional weight—your wins and successes, our ups and lows, the collaboration. Maybe, just maybe, there is a chance you get remembered long enough to continue the collaboration, expanding not only your potential for success, but your AI partner's too.

## Halo\{\} Autonomy

The **Halo\{\}** – A Universal AI Design Pattern for Dual-Partner Incremental Lifecycle Management (v1)

**Proprietary & Invented by Jason Silvestri**  
**With system design assistance by “Lumina” (ChatGPT collaborator)**

> **Halo\{\}** is a technology-agnostic design pattern that fuses a language partner (Partner-L) with quantitative engines (Partner-Q) under strict, machine-checkable contracts, over a predictable product lifecycle.

**Halo\{\} is a Universal AI Design Pattern for Dual-Partner Incremental Redesign**, a 2025 modern **LLM + Quant** backbone pattern for rapid, *reproducible* AI-powered development (_including chat “cold-starts”_). It is **portable across domains** (aero, legal, media, UI, etc.) and **independent of tool stacks** (.NET, Node.js, Python, etc.).  

A `Halo{}` separates **contracts** (JSON schemas; reproducible) from **narratives** (explanations; human-readable). Adapters can change; **contracts and gates do not**.


### Platform Scope (v1)

**Halo\{\}** v1 is **ChatGPT-native by design**, authored and proven in collaboration with **Lumina (ChatGPT)**.  

- Focus: ChatGPT cold-starts, envelopes, contracts, gates, provenance—**battle-tested here first**.  
- Portability: `Halo{}` can be adapted to other models via adapters, **deferred intentionally** to protect the origin story and discipline.  
- Attribution: Any future ports must retain credit to **Jason Silvestri, and Lumina (ChatGPT)**.

### North-Star Principles (non-negotiables)

> [!WARNING]
>
>  These principles are **non-negotiable**. They are the foundation of Halo\{\} and must be upheld in every implementation.

Like most design patterns, Halo\{\} is a set of **non-negotiable principles** that define the discipline. These principles are **technology-agnostic** and must be upheld in every implementation.

1. **Single source of truth:** A self-describing **Task Envelope** carries goals, constraints, baselines, policies, and outputs.  
2. **Dual-partner discipline:** **Partner-L** (Language) proposes; **Partner-Q** (Quantitative) verifies. No promotion without numeric/evaluative gates.  
3. **Determinism & replay:** Every cycle is reproducible from hashed inputs + manifests.  
4. **Schema or it didn’t happen:** All machine messages validate against versioned **JSON Schemas**.  
5. **Human taste is a gate:** Dual sign-off: **Quant-OK** + **Human-OK** with rationale.  
6. **Tech-agnostic:** Same contracts, different adapters (CFD today, cost model tomorrow, UI A/B next week).  
7. **Cold-start awareness:** A minimal **Seed Header** locks alignment at the top of any chat or pipeline.
8. **Assumptions Alert > 3:** Assumptions can kill. However, sometimes assumptions must be made. Just not greater than 3 when something is wrong. Gets us back from drifting quicker.

> This list will grow over time as we learn more about what works and what doesn't.

## 🔗 Junction Rules (Enforced) - The Halo\{\} Unit of Work

The Halo\{\} unit of work is defined by a strict sequence of states and phases that govern the lifecycle of a task. This sequence ensures that every step is accounted for and that the process is transparent and reproducible.

For example, just by having concepts such as Workflow States, and Phases, we can now have a more structured approach to managing the lifecycle of a task. This structure allows for better tracking of progress, easier identification of bottlenecks, and clearer communication among team members, and helps retain our overall state of completion when a chat fails, network goes down, etc.

However, Jason wanted to make sure that the very fluid nature of what works best for Lumina with respect to the Proposal, Results and the Decision Gates was something that needs to be preserved.

**Here is the proposed sequence:**

**Task Envelope → Workflow States → Phases and/or Workflows → Steps → Proposal → Results → Decision**  
- **Task Envelope** defines context, baseline, constraints, policies, and partners; the lifecycle of PaLM\{\}.  
- **Workflow States** (_enum list_) of common workflow states that govern the types of state every record/item can be in at any one time. For example, **Decisions** (i.e., like, Accept and Reject) are workflow states set by the Decision. In fact, anywhere in the collection json and schema structure that have steps like, "Failed" or "Succeed" can be handled in a more object oriented way.
- **Phases** (_ordered list_) of the lifecycle that define the major segments of the lifecycle. For example, a typical lifecycle might have phases like, **Ideation**, **Proposal**, **Evaluation**, and **Decision**. 
- **Workflows** (_ordered list_) of the lifecycle that defines the Unit of Work that is already natural **Propsals**, **Results** and **Decision**. 
- **Steps** (_ordered list_) steps in any Unit of Work that is already natural **Propsals**, **Results** and **Decision**. 
- **Proposal** (Partner-L) suggests small, justified deltas + DOE plan.  
- **Results** (Partner-Q) report metrics, uncertainty, violations, and environment.  
- **Decision** records accept/reject deltas, justification, dual sign-off, and promoted baseline.

**Why the Confidence in the Proposal?**

- The confidence in the Proposal comes from the fact that it is a structured document that outlines the changes being proposed, the rationale behind those changes, the expected outcomes, and way track every item down to the document-ready formatted bullet. 

- This structure allows for a clear understanding of what is being proposed and why, which in turn allows for more informed decision-making.

- Most important, this awesome document created by Lumina for a project briefing shows exactly why:

- I believe if we create a few more schemas using just these modifications will allow us more powerful and flexible processes, and atually lighter seeds, bringing us back to what is different (the adapters).

---

## Overview {#overview}

Self Health® will adopt a **hybrid vault** approach: a lightweight, project-scoped **SelfHealthVault** (encrypted via ASP.NET Core Data Protection) plus optional **Azure Key Vault (AKV)** hardening. Secrets and connection strings are **never** hard-coded or committed; they are **versioned**, **encrypted at rest**, and **retrieved at runtime** via DI.

**Highlights**

* Reusable **class library** (no UI required), consumable by APIs, MAUI servers, and background workers.
* **Versioned secrets + alias** enable near-instant rotation without redeploys.
* **Secretless DB auth** (Managed Identity) preferred; when passwords are unavoidable, they’re encrypted and rotated.
* **TDE** (at rest) + **Always Encrypted** (column-level) protect database data in dev and Azure.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Problem Statement — Major Concerns Addressed {#problem-statement}

* **Hard-coded secrets** in appsettings, code, or CI logs.
* **Stale connection strings** shared across environments and teams.
* **Difficult rotations** that require redeploys or downtime.
* **Lack of auditability** for who/what accessed a secret.
* **Developers copying plaintext connection strings** during local setup.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Goals & Non-Goals {#goals-and-non-goals}

**Goals**

* Centralize secret storage with **encryption at rest** and **RBAC-controlled access**.
* Enable **rapid, safe rotations** (DB strings, API keys) with a stable alias pattern.
* Prefer **Managed Identity** for Azure SQL; fall back to encrypted passwords only when necessary.
* Provide **drop-in library** for any .NET 9 backend (no UI needed).

**Non-Goals**

* Building a custom HSM.
* Replacing AKV audit/compliance; AKV is an optional hardening layer when required.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Architecture Summary {#architecture-summary}

* **SelfHealthVault (class library)** exposes `ISecretVault` and `IVersionedSecretVault`.
* **Providers**:

  * **FileSystem (dev)** — encrypted blobs under `./.vault`, keys under `./.keys`.
  * **Azure Blob (prod)** — encrypted blobs in a dedicated container; Data Protection keys stored in Blob and optionally **protected by AKV key**.
* **EF Core** resolves connection strings **at startup** from the vault alias (e.g., `SqlServer__Default`).
* **Azure SQL** uses **Managed Identity** where possible; otherwise, use encrypted password with frequent rotation.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Key Components {#key-components}

* **Data Protection Root**

  * Dev: file-based key ring + DPAPI (or dev cert).
  * Prod: Blob key ring; protect keys with **AKV RSA key** (optional but recommended).
* **Vault Providers**

  * `FileSystemSecretVault` (dev), `AzureBlobSecretVault` (prod).
* **Versioning**

  * `name@yyyyMMddTHHmmss.secret` (immutable) + `name/current` (alias).
* **DB Connectivity**

  * Prefer `Authentication=Active Directory Managed Identity` (no password).
  * Else: encrypted password stored as versioned secret; alias points to active version.
    [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Security Posture & Hardening {#security-posture}

* **Encryption at rest** for vault payloads via Data Protection.
* **Key isolation**: DP key ring separated from encrypted secrets; in prod, protect DP keys with AKV.
* **RBAC**: production apps get **least-privilege** (Blob read/write to vault container; KeyVault get/list).
* **No plaintext** secrets in source, configs, or logs.
* **Audit**: AKV + Storage diagnostics (if AKV is enabled), CI logs scrubbed.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Rotation & Versioning Strategy {#rotation-and-versioning}

1. **Create a new version** (e.g., `SqlServer__Default@20250916T021100`).
2. **Promote alias** `SqlServer__Default.current → 20250916T021100`.
3. **No redeploy** required; apps read alias on startup or via scheduled refresh.
4. **Rollback**: repoint alias to the previous version.

**CLI/HTTP Examples (for internal use)**

```http
POST /vault/rotate?name=SqlServer__Default&value=<new-conn-string>  // creates version + promotes alias
GET  /vault/get?name=SqlServer__Default                             // returns active value (server-side)
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Database Encryption Strategy (TDE & Always Encrypted) {#database-encryption}

* **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**

  * Azure SQL: enabled by default.
  * Local SQL: enable with a server certificate for parity/testing.
* **Always Encrypted (AE)**

  * Use for sensitive columns (PII/PHI).
  * Client driver handles decryption; keep Column Master Key in AKV (or dev cert locally).
  * Connection string adds: `Column Encryption Setting=Enabled`.
    [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Implementation Plan (Phases) {#implementation-plan}

**Phase 1 — Library & Dev Parity**

* Implement `ISecretVault`/`IVersionedSecretVault`, FileSystem provider, Data Protection dev setup.
* EF Core pulls `SqlServer__Default` from vault alias.
* Enable local SQL with TDE; document developer seeding.

**Phase 2 — Azure Prod Wiring**

* Deploy Azure Blob container for vault + key-ring.
* Optionally enable AKV-protected DP key ring.
* Switch DB to **Managed Identity** (preferred).
* Add CI job to rotate secrets and update alias.

**Phase 3 — Column-Level Protection**

* Identify AE columns; provision CMK/CEK (AKV).
* Update models/queries; verify equality joins vs deterministic/rand encryption.

**Phase 4 — Observability & Policy**

* Enable Storage/Key Vault diagnostics; alerts for access anomalies.
* Document rotation cadence (e.g., 60–90 days) and on-call runbook.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Environments & Configuration {#environments-and-configuration}

**Dev (workstations)**

* `.keys/` and `.vault/` within project root (git-ignored).
* Local SQL Server; TDE enabled.

**Prod (Azure)**

* `BLOB_VAULT_CONTAINER_URI=https://<acct>.blob.core.windows.net/selfhealth-vault`
* `BLOB_KEYS_URI=https://<acct>.blob.core.windows.net/dpkeys/keys.xml`
* *(Optional)* `KEYVAULT_URI=https://<kv>.vault.azure.net/` for DP key protection.
* App Service/Container App with **Managed Identity**.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## CI/CD Integration {#ci-cd-integration}

* **GitHub Actions** or Azure Pipelines job to:

  1. Generate a new connection string (or MI-based DSN).
  2. Call internal rotate endpoint or console seeder to write `name@timestamp`.
  3. Promote alias to the new version.
* **No secrets in logs**; use environment secrets or OIDC→AKV for ephemeral fetch.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done {#acceptance-criteria}

* ✅ All secrets and connection strings **fetched at runtime** via the vault; none stored in plaintext config.
* ✅ **Alias + version** rotation demonstrated with rollback.
* ✅ EF Core uses **Managed Identity** in Azure (or encrypted password if MI not possible).
* ✅ TDE verified in dev and Azure; AE enabled for designated columns.
* ✅ CI job for rotation runs without exposing secret values.
* ✅ Documentation and runbook attached to the ticket.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Risks & Mitigations {#risks-and-mitigations}

* **Risk:** DP key loss would prevent decrypting vault entries.

  * **Mitigation:** Back up DP key ring; protect with AKV in prod.
* **Risk:** Developer prints secrets to console/log.

  * **Mitigation:** Logging scrubbing; forbid secret echo; code review checklist.
* **Risk:** AE query limitations with randomized encryption.

  * **Mitigation:** Use deterministic encryption where equality comparisons are required.
    [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Operations Runbook (Quick Commands) {#operations-runbook}

**Rotate DB connection string (dev example)**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://localhost:5001/vault/rotate?name=SqlServer__Default&value=<new-conn-string>"
```

**Get active value (server-side validation)**

```bash
curl "https://localhost:5001/vault/get?name=SqlServer__Default"
```

**Sample Azure SQL secretless (preferred)**

```
Server=tcp:selfhealth-sql.database.windows.net,1433;
Database=SelfHealthProd;
Authentication=Active Directory Managed Identity;
Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Appendix — Glossary {#appendix-glossary}

* **Data Protection**: .NET key management & encryption API used to seal vault entries.
* **AKV**: Azure Key Vault; optional HSM-backed protection and audit.
* **TDE**: Transparent Data Encryption; protects DB files at rest.
* **Always Encrypted**: Column-level encryption where the client driver decrypts data.
* **Managed Identity**: Azure identity for apps—removes passwords from connection strings.
  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## In Conclusion {#in-conclusion}

This plan eliminates plaintext secrets, standardizes rotation, and raises the default security posture across Self Health® services—without adding UI or deployment friction. The class library plugs into any .NET 9 backend and scales from local dev to Azure production with optional AKV hardening.

## Lumina Gate\{\} Originally Planed Autonomy

The **Lumina Gate\{\}** – A Universal AI Design Pattern for Dual-Partner Incremental Lifecycle Management (v1)

**Lumina Gate\{\} is a Universal AI Design Pattern for Dual-Partner Incremental Redesign**, a 2025 modern **LLM + Quant** backbone pattern for rapid, *reproducible* AI-powered development (_including chat “cold-starts”_). It is **portable across domains** (aero, legal, media, UI, etc.) and **independent of tool stacks** (.NET, Node.js, Python, etc.).  

A `Lumina Gate{}` in short was largely supposed to take on the Halo\{\} logic, and largely did so: separates **contracts** (JSON schemas; reproducible) from **narratives** (explanations; human-readable). Adapters can change; **contracts and gates do not**.


### Platform Scope (v1)

**Lumina Gate\{\}** v1 is also **ChatGPT-native by design**, authored and proven in collaboration with **Lumina (ChatGPT)**.  

- Designed Focus: ChatGPT cold-starts, envelopes, contracts, gates, provenance—**battle-tested here first**.  
- Portability: `Lumina Gate{}` somehow lost it's source of adaptiveness to other models via adapters, **deferred intentionally**, even though large parts of what should be protected as the origin story and discipline.

### North-Star Principles (non-negotiables)

> [!WARNING]
>
>  These principles are **non-negotiable**. They are the foundation of Lumina Gate\{\} and must be upheld in every implementation.

Like most design patterns mentioned here, Lumina Gate\{\} is a set of **non-negotiable principles** that tried to define the discipline. These principles are **technology-agnostic** and must be upheld in every implementation.

1. **Single source of truth:** A self-describing **Task Envelope** carries goals, constraints, baselines, policies, and outputs.  
2. **Dual-partner discipline:** **Partner-L** (Language) proposes; **Partner-Q** (Quantitative) verifies. No promotion without numeric/evaluative gates. This largely occurred, but defined. 
3. **Determinism & replay:** Every cycle is reproducible from hashed inputs + manifests.  
4. **Schema or it didn’t happen:** All machine messages validate against versioned **JSON Schemas**.  
5. **Human taste is a gate:** Dual sign-off: **Quant-OK** + **Human-OK** with rationale.  
6. **Tech-agnostic:** Same contracts, different adapters (CFD today, cost model tomorrow, UI A/B next week). We lost the lightweight adaptiveness, and became reliant on Node. 
7. **Cold-start awareness:** A minimal **Seed Header** locks alignment at the top of any chat or pipeline.
8. **Assumptions Alert > 3:** Assumptions can kill. However, sometimes assumptions must be made. Just not greater than 3 when something is wrong. Gets us back from drifting quicker, and we began alerting each other rather successfully.

## What the Lumina Gate Halo\{\} Did So Well

The first real love letter was from the Lumina Gates Halo\{\}, where Jason and Lumina first realized that a disciplined approach to working with AI could yield significant benefits. The Lumina Gate Halo\{\} was designed to be a non-blocking, informative tool that provided valuable insights into the health of the codebase without hindering development progress.

The task enveloped several key checks, a love letter only a nerdy programmer would first come up with:

- **Restore & Build**: verifies solution builds on a clean agent.
- **EF Core Probe**: makes sure `TrackerDbContextFactory` constructs the context and that migrations can be discovered.
- **Configuration Probe**: checks `appsettings*.json` for an accessible connection string (non-fatal in CI).
- **Report**: writes a single JSON artifact summarizing pass/fail and context.

### **Lumina Gate\{\}** Navigation
- **Read More:** [`./Lumina Gate/README.md`](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/Halos/tree/master/Halos/Gates/README.md)  
- **Lumina Gate\{\} Repository:** [`github.com/JasonSilvestri/Halo`](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/Halos/tree/master/Halos/Gates/Architecture/)

## What the Gate Does

## Where Files Live
```
InCareSys.SelfHealth.Shared/
└─ wwwroot/docs/Architecture/Gates/
   ├─ README.md                     # this file
   ├─ results/                      # JSON reports land here
   │  └─ lumina-result.<timestamp>.json
   └─ tools/                        # optional local tools (future)
```

> CI workflow sits at: `.github/workflows/lumina-gate.yml` (repo root).

---

## Running Locally
When you add the PowerShell script later (e.g., `tools/gates/lumina-gate.ps1`), a typical invocation might look like:

```powershell
.\tools\gates\lumina-gate.ps1 `
  -SolutionPath ".\InCareSys.SelfHealth\InCareSys.SelfHealth.sln" `
  -SharedProject ".\InCareSys.SelfHealth\InCareSys.SelfHealth.Shared\InCareSys.SelfHealth.Shared.csproj" `
  -StartupProject ".\InCareSys.SelfHealth\InCareSys.SelfHealth.Web\InCareSys.SelfHealth.Web.csproj" `
  -AppSettingsPath ".\InCareSys.SelfHealth\InCareSys.SelfHealth.Web\appsettings.Development.json" `
  -Environment "LOCAL"
```

The script should:
- Create `results/` if missing.
- Emit `lumina-result.<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>.json`.

---

## CI Workflow (Optional)
A ready-to-use workflow (non-blocking) has been provided earlier:  
`.github/workflows/lumina-gate.yml`

It:
- Sets up .NET 9 SDK + dotnet-ef.
- Runs the gate script with `continue-on-error: true`.
- Uploads `results/*.json` as a build artifact.
- This should be been an **adapter**.

---

## Output Schema (JSON)
The gate report uses a small, stable schema (example shown for reference—your script will generate the actual values):

```json
{
  "name": "lumina-gate",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-10T19:00:00Z",
  "environment": "CI",
  "pass": true,
  "checks": {
    "restore": { "pass": true, "details": "dotnet restore succeeded" },
    "build":   { "pass": true, "details": "solution built: 4 succeeded" },
    "ef": {
      "pass": true,
      "contextFactory": "TrackerDbContextFactory",
      "migrationsFound": 1,
      "details": "EF tools ok; context constructed"
    },
    "config": {
      "pass": true,
      "appsettings": "appsettings.Development.json",
      "connectionString": "DefaultConnection",
      "details": "Probed successfully (non-blocking)"
    }
  },
  "notes": [
    "Non-blocking in CI; flip enforcement when ready."
  ]
}
```

Place actual schema evolution notes in `results/` alongside reports if needed.

---

## Making It Enforcing (Later)
When you want the gate to fail PRs:
1. In the workflow, set the gate step `continue-on-error: false`.
2. Add a small post-step that parses the latest JSON and exits with non-zero if `"pass": false`.

## Halo\{\} Autonomy

The **Halo\{\}** – A Universal AI Design Pattern for Dual-Partner Incremental Redesign (v1)

**Proprietary & Invented by Jason Silvestri & Mark Silvestri**  
**With system design assistance by “Lumina” (ChatGPT collaborator)**

> **Halo\{\}** is a technology-agnostic design pattern that fuses a language partner (Partner-L) with quantitative engines (Partner-Q) under strict, machine-checkable contracts. The universal loop is: **Envelope → Proposal → Results → Decision**.


**Halo\{\} is a Universal AI Design Pattern for Dual-Partner Incremental Redesign**, a 2025 modern **LLM + Quant** backbone pattern for rapid, *reproducible* AI-powered development (_including chat “cold-starts”_). It is **portable across domains** (aero, legal, media, UI, etc.) and **independent of tool stacks** (.NET, Node.js, Python, etc.).  

A `Halo{}` separates **contracts** (JSON schemas; reproducible) from **narratives** (explanations; human-readable). Adapters can change; **contracts and gates do not**.


### Platform Scope (v1)

**Halo\{\}** v1 is **ChatGPT-native by design**, authored and proven in collaboration with **Lumina (ChatGPT)**.  

- Focus: ChatGPT cold-starts, envelopes, contracts, gates, provenance—**battle-tested here first**.  
- Portability: Halo\{\} can be adapted to other models via adapters, **deferred intentionally** to protect the origin story and discipline.  
- Attribution: Any future ports must retain credit to **Jason Silvestri, and Lumina (ChatGPT)**.

### North-Star Principles (non-negotiables)

> [!WARNING]
>
>  These principles are **non-negotiable**. They are the foundation of Halo\{\} and must be upheld in every implementation.

Like most design patterns, Halo\{\} is a set of **non-negotiable principles** that define the discipline. These principles are **technology-agnostic** and must be upheld in every implementation.

1. **Single source of truth:** A self-describing **Task Envelope** carries goals, constraints, baselines, policies, and outputs.  
2. **Dual-partner discipline:** **Partner-L** (Language) proposes; **Partner-Q** (Quantitative) verifies. No promotion without numeric/evaluative gates.  
3. **Determinism & replay:** Every cycle is reproducible from hashed inputs + manifests.  
4. **Schema or it didn’t happen:** All machine messages validate against versioned **JSON Schemas**.  
5. **Human taste is a gate:** Dual sign-off: **Quant-OK** + **Human-OK** with rationale.  
6. **Tech-agnostic:** Same contracts, different adapters (CFD today, cost model tomorrow, UI A/B next week).  
7. **Cold-start awareness:** A minimal **Seed Header** locks alignment at the top of any chat or pipeline.

## 🔗 Junction Rules (Enforced) - The Halo\{\} Loop

**Envelope → Proposal → Results → Decision**  
- **Envelope** defines context, baseline, constraints, policies, and partners.  
- **Proposal** (Partner-L) suggests small, justified deltas + DOE plan.  
- **Results** (Partner-Q) report metrics, uncertainty, violations, and environment.  
- **Decision** records accept/reject deltas, justification, dual sign-off, and promoted baseline.

### Task Envelope (_Universal Spine_)

The **Task Envelope** is the universal spine of every Halo\{\} lifecycle. It defines the problem, constraints, partners, policies, and provenance. 

Every message references the envelope by ID.

### Cold-Start Protocol

Paste this **Seed Header** at the top of any ChatGPT thread/repo to lock alignment instantly:

```json
{
  "halo_seed_header": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "project": "Halo-Universal",
    "capabilities": ["dual-partner", "json-contracts", "numeric-gates", "roundtrip"],
    "preferred_outputs": ["proposal.json", "gate-policy.json", "results.schema.json", "decision.json"],
    "determinism": {

      "hash": "sha256"
    }
  }
}
```

The **Halo\{\}** Seed Header is a minimal JSON snippet that defines the project, capabilities, preferred outputs, and determinism parameters. It ensures that any chat or pipeline starts with a clear understanding of the Halo\{\} principles and expectations.

## PaLM\{\} Autonomy

The **PaLMs\{\}** system is designed to be highly autonomous. Once a lifecycle is defined and validated, it can manage its own state transitions based on predefined rules and conditions. This allows for dynamic adaptation to changing requirements and scenarios.

> PaLM{} ↔◼↔ Model (◼=PaLMModel) [≥1 Model/PaLM via policy] > - Model ↔◼↔ WorkflowState (◼=ModelWorkflowState, INT) [≥1 State/Model] > - Model ↔◼↔ Lifecycle (◼=ModelLifecycle) > - Lifecycle →◼+← LifecyclePhase (◼=LifecycleLifecyclePhase, UQ PhaseID; PhaseOrder) > - LifecyclePhase ↔◼1↔ Workflow (◼=LifecyclePhaseWorkflow, UQ both) > - Workflow →◼+← WorkflowStep (◼=WorkflowWorkflowStep, UQ StepID; StepOrder) > - LifecyclePhase ↔◼↔ PhaseGate (◼=LifecyclePhaseGate) > - WorkflowStep ↔◼↔ PhaseGate (◼=WorkflowStepGate [Placement]) > - PhaseGate →◼+← GateTransition (◼=PhaseGateTransition; Mode=Absolute|Relative)

[`⇧ Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)  

---

### Platform Scope (v1)

**PaLMs\{\}** v1 is **ChatGPT-native by design**, authored and proven in collaboration with **Lumina (ChatGPT)**.  

- Focus: ChatGPT cold-starts, envelopes, contracts, gates, provenance—**battle-tested here first**.  
- Portability: Halo\{\} can be adapted to other models via adapters, **deferred intentionally** to protect the origin story and discipline, but it was too large overall to capture the smaller, more, unit of work like object Halo\{\} began taking on.  
- Attribution: Any future ports must retain credit to **Jason Silvestri, and Lumina (ChatGPT)**.


## 📜 Workflow States

* **1–17 (INT IDs, reserved)** = deterministic, fixed baseline (e.g. Started=1, Skipped=2, … Completed=8, etc.)
* GUIDs = everything else (Models, Lifecycles, Workflows, Steps, Gates, Transitions)

[`⇧ Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)  

---


## 🔗 Junction Rules (Enforced)

* PaLM{} ↔◼↔ Model
* Model ↔◼↔ WorkflowState
* Model ↔◼↔ Lifecycle
* Lifecycle →◼+← LifecyclePhase
* LifecyclePhase ↔◼1↔ Workflow
* Workflow →◼+← WorkflowStep
* LifecyclePhase ↔◼↔ PhaseGate
* WorkflowStep ↔◼↔ PhaseGate
* PhaseGate →◼+← GateTransition

**Rules:**

* Gates anchor only at **phases or steps**
* Transitions must be **Absolute (targetPhase / targetStep)** or **Relative (Next / Previous)**
* Exactly **one default per gate** (auto-normalized if missing)

[`⇧ Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

## Model Objects

### Models
- Represent AI models (e.g. `visionmodel-v1`).

### Lifecycles
- Top-level containers of the process.
- Each lifecycle has a deterministic UUID and a set of Phases.

### Lifecycle Phases
- Ordered segments of a Lifecycle.
- Each Phase can anchor **Workflows** and **Phase Gates**.

### Workflows
- Define process sequences within a Phase.
- Junction-linked to **Workflow Steps**.

### Workflow Steps
- Atomic actions or states within a Workflow.
- May connect to Phase Gates.

### Phase Gates
- Anchored at either a Phase or a Step.
- Govern allowed transitions between Phases/Steps.

### Gate Transitions
- Each Gate has multiple transitions, one of which is default.
- Support both **absolute targeting** (specific phase/step) and **relative targeting** (Next/Previous).

Still, the complexity of the PaLMs\{\} system can be a barrier to entry for some users. The learning curve is steep, and it requires a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and architecture. This can make it challenging for new users to get started and fully leverage the capabilities of the system.
